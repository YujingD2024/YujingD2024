### Positions

My research group is recruiting two fully-funded Ph.D. students through Research Assistantships in the Department of Petroleum Engineering at the University of Tulsa. The expected start date is Fall 2025. Benefits include a monthly stipend, a full tuition waiver, and health and dental insurance coverage, per the policies of the university and the Department of Petroleum Engineering.

### Research directions

Multiphase flow, transport, phase change, and reactions in fractured and porous media (such as oil and gas reservoirs, aquifers, soils, biological tissues, etc.), fluid-driven fracture mechanics, and rheology of complex fluids and soft materials (such as polymers, gels, foams, colloids suspensions, etc.). Applications include fossil energy recovery, geothermal energy systems, soil remediation, geological sequestration and storage, and more.

### Responsibilities

- Design and conduct experiments in natural porous media and meticulously designed artificial model systems
- Conduct visualization, measurement, and analysis of the dynamics in the model systems
- Measure and analyze the rheological, interfacial, and acoustic properties of complex fluids and soft materials such as polymers, foams, gels, and colloid suspensions in bulk phase and within micron confinements.

### Career opportunities

- Summer internships in academic laboratories and the industry
- Research/academic positions in the universities and national laboratories
- Oil and gas industry

### Qualifications

1. B.S. and/or M.S. degree in engineering, sciences, or a relevant field with a minimum GPA of 3.0/4.0

2. Meet the minimum test requirements for graduate admission: TOFEL > 80 or IELTS > 6.5, GRE recommended but can be waived

3. Good written and communication skills, eager to collaborate

4. Self-motivated and dedicated to research

5. Experience in microfabrication, microfluidics, and microscopy is a bonus

6. Experience in particle imaging velocimetry (PIV), and 3D printing is a bonus

7. Experience in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is a bonus

### To apply, please email me (yujingdu@seas.harvard.edu) and send the following three materials

1. CV or resume

2. Unofficial transcript

3. Names and contact information (email address is preferred) of two to three references

### The University

The University of Tulsa (https://utulsa.edu/) is a prestigious private school located at the center of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Tulsa, also known as the “Oil Capital of the World”, is the second-most-populous city in Oklahoma. There is a one-hour drive to the capital of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, and a four-hour drive to Dallas, Texas. The Arkansas River runs through the city center from the northwest to the southeast, flanked by parks, running trails, and visitor spots. With its long history, rich cultural heritage, and abundant natural scenery, Tulsa offers residents a vibrant city life, easy access to nature, and affordable living.

The University of Tulsa’s petroleum engineering research program is a leader in its field. The program now encompasses a wide range of topics from traditional oil and gas production to emerging renewable energy technologies. The University of Tulsa boasts an international reputation and actively enhances its global impact by strengthening international collaborations. The University of Tulsa maintains strong connections with industries and businesses through its alumni networks. Its engineering departments, particularly, have robust collaborations and networks with the energy industry, providing excellent job opportunities.

### The Lab

Dr. Yujing Du received a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin in Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering in 2021, following an M.S. degree in the same department in 2016. Yujing earned a B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in Thermal Engineering (now named Energy and Power Engineering) in 2014. Dr. Du worked as a postdoctoral fellow in Applied Physics under the supervision of Dr. David Weitz at Harvard University before joining the University of Tulsa as an Assistant Processor in the Department of Petroleum Engineering in January 2025.

Dr. Du’s research lab focuses on the fundamental physics and mechanisms affecting the flow, transport, and reactive behaviors in fractured and porous media. Their research focuses on interfacial phenomena, rheology of complex fluids, phase behaviors, and hydraulic fracturing dynamics, all within the context of flow and transport in microscale confinements. By exploring the science at micron and nanoscale levels, their research uncovers the secrets of subsurface processes, both natural and engineered. This knowledge is essential for developing solutions in energy and resource recovery and achieving carbon neutrality. Ultimately, their efforts pave the way for a more sustainable and environmentally responsible future.
